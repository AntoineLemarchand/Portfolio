### Presentation
This project aimed to recreate a very basic shell with redirections, a few builtins and a pipe system.
It was the first of the cursus to give the option to achieve it in a grou of two.

The builtins:
- echo with the -n option
- pwd
- exit
- env
- export

### Usage
```
$ ./minishell
```
You can then use the shell as you please.

### Limits
As any first group project, getting the ideas can be a little overwhelming. Even with the great teammate that i had, the development process was a bit tedious and chaotic.

The codebase was hard to modify and breaking quite often.

The validating process was very tedious and took a toll on our moral toward the end, lowering our code quality.
