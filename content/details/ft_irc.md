### Presentation
This project aimed to recreate a simple irc server.
It was the last big project of the common core to be written in C++

We were a lot more interested by good practice and unit testing,
this produce a much cleaner and extensible codebase.

### Usage
```
$ ./ft_irc <port> <password>
```

### Limits

Appart from learning the irc protocol, I thought I would learn more about
socket programming and http.
