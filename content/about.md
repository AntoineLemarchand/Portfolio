### Studies
I am currently studying in [school 42Paris](https://42.fr/).
I have a bachelor degree in statistics from the university of Rennes 2.

### Tools
I am mostly coding with vim and tmux on an atreus42.

### Other
I'm a bassist in [a band](https://open.spotify.com/artist/6ckLtEwca1zs8zdcW3FPkG).
I also have an interest for anything electronic (hence the homemade keyboard).
As all developer should, I love open software but havent had the occasion to help to a big project for now.
